# EngravedWalls
Smooth and engrave walls like in Dwarf Fortress! (Inspired by Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf))

Current Features:
Engraved walls count as art, and have all the benefits associated with that.
Pawn's Artistic ability affects their quality.
Their quality affects their beauty.
They get randomly generated descriptions, and if they're impressive enough, can even warrant having art made of their construction.
Engravings of engravings!
Smooth/engraved walls are still removed with the Mining skill. (And still drop chunks)

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. I know this is a derivative work but there's always room for improvement!


NOTICE:
This mod has been re-written for the ground up for version 1.0, and is now available through the Steam Workshop.
This version is unlikely to be updated except for emergency bug fixes.


=====

Compatibility:

"Engraved Walls" is compatible with mods that add new natural stones (As long as they follow Vanilla naming conventions), as well as many embrasure adding mods.
=====

Credits:

A vast majority of the work on this mod comes from Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)'s "Smooth Stone Walls" mod. I only made tiny edits to tie it into the vanilla art system and simplified some of the base code.

The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library." (No additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod.)
