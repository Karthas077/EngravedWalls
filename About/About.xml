Engrave walls like in Dwarf Fortress!

Current Features:
Engraved walls count as art, and have all the benefits associated with that.
Pawn's Artistic ability affects their quality.
Their quality affects their beauty.
They get randomly generated descriptions, and if they're impressive enough, can even warrant having art made of their construction.
Engravings of engravings!

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

=====

Compatibility:

"Engraved Walls" is compatible with mods that add new natural stones as long as they incorporate 1.0's smoothedThing field.
It is extremely unlikely for it to be compatible with any embrasure adding mods.
=====

Credits:

The b18 version of this mod was heavily inspired by Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)'s "Smooth Stone Walls" mod.
With the inclusion of smoothed walls in vanilla 1.0, I have rewritten the mod from the ground up for maximum stability and maximum compatibility.

The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library." (No additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod.)
